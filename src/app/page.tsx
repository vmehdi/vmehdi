              <p>
                I’m a product‑driven software engineer with 15+ years of experience — starting from the early days of HTML/CSS, and evolving into building
                scalable, distributed analytics platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally rooted in front‑end engineering, I’ve grown into a full‑stack architect who designs and delivers production-grade systems. I’ve led
                complex projects involving:
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
                  <li>Modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt)</li>
                  <li>Back-end architecture using Node.js, Bun, and Elysia.js</li>
                  <li>Real-time infrastructure with WebSocket, Kafka, Redis, and QuestDB</li>
                  <li>Distributed system design, config/versioning/CDN strategies</li>
                  <li>CI/CD pipelines, Docker, DevOps, and server security (UFW, RAID, Nginx, TLS)</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                I enjoy turning abstract ideas into working systems — from tracking scripts used across production websites, to building backends that handle
                millions of events per day.
              </p>
              {/* <p className="mt-2">
                My recent work includes building an advanced user behavior tracking platform similar to Hotjar/Segment, with real‑time A/B testing, heatmaps,
                session replays, and a custom analytics pipeline using Kafka + Flink + Postgres/QuestDB — fully containerized and cloud‑ready.
              </p> */}
              <p className="mt-2">
                I thrive at the intersection of product, engineering, and infrastructure — and I’m always learning, optimizing, and mentoring.
